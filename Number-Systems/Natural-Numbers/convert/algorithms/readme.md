# Algorithms to convert between Number-Systems

## Structure

### [to_base.py](./to_base.py)

Converts numbers written in decimal to a target number system.

### [to_decimal.py](./to_decimal.py)

Converts numbers written in some number system to decimal.

### [00-Archive](./00-Archive/)

Some exploratory algorithms on how to convert between number systems.

Might contain some different implementations of the algorithms needed by this project.
