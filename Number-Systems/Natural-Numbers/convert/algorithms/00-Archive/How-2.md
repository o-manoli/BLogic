# On Numbers

Like [Plato's allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) the numbers you use everyday [are just shadow](https://youtu.be/1RWOpQXTltA) of a much abstract concept of a number.

## Representation

Changing the base in which the number is written, shouldn't change the essence of it.

A prime number is still a prime number no matter the base it's written in or even the symbols used to represent it.
